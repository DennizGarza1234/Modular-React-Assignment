# Modular-React-Assignment

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to gain hands-on experience with **component modularity** in React by creating a small application that uses both **default and named exports/imports**. The app demonstrates reusable components, proper import/export patterns, and unit testing to ensure functionality.

---

## Project Overview
This React application consists of the following components:

- **Header** (default export) — top section of the app  
- **Footer** (default export) — bottom section of the app  
- **ContentA** (named export) — first content section with a reusable Button  
- **ContentB** (named export) — second content section with a reusable Button  
- **SharedComponents.js** (named export) — contains a reusable **Button** component  

The `App.js` file assembles all components into a cohesive layout, demonstrating how **default and named exports** can be used together.
